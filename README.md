# Image-Classification-System


# 🧠 Image Classification System

A powerful and efficient Image Classification System built using Python and Machine Learning libraries. This project demonstrates how to classify images into various categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and relevant data preprocessing, training, and evaluation techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Image Classification System** is designed to recognize and categorize images from a dataset into predefined classes. It leverages deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras and uses standard datasets or custom datasets (like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a user-provided image set) to train and validate the model.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 📂 Support for custom and standard image datasets
- 🧠 Deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- 📊 Accuracy tracking with graphs for training and validation
- 🖼️ Real-time image prediction support
- 📝 Confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation
- 💾 Model saving and loading for future inference
- 📸 Jupyter Notebook Interface for ease of use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional for image input)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation

Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-system.git
cd image-classification-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 🧪 Dataset

You can use any image classification dataset. To use a custom dataset, ensure it's structured like:

```
/dataset/
    /class_1/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
    /class_2/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
```

### 🧮 Training the Model

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Image_Class_Model-checkpoint.ipynb
```

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

### 🔍 Predict on New Images

After training, load your model and use:

```python
from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('image_classifier_model.h5')

# Predict
img = load_and_preprocess('test_image.jpg')
prediction = model.predict(img)
```

## 📈 Results

* Achieved up to **XX% accuracy** on validation dataset
* Visualized training vs. validation loss and accuracy
* Confusion matrix and detailed classification report generated
